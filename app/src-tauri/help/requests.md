# :icon[request] Requests
In Apicize, Requests define the webservice endpoint you want to call and test.  At a minimum, each request requires a URL and method to be defined.

Requests can optionally be *grouped*, which allows request tests to be run in sequence, and optionally pass values between them.  This can be useful, for example, when testing a sequence of API calls to create, retrieve, update and delete a record (i.e. CRUD).

Requests are edited using the following panes:

* [**Info**](help:requests/info)
* [**Query String**](help:requests/query)
* [**Headers**](help:requests/headers)
* [**Body**](help:requests/body)
* [**Test**](help:requests/test)
