# The Not Yet License

This application is distributed AS-IS, without warranty or assurance of fitness for purpose.  In fact, it's probably not
fit for your purpose, unless your purpose is to over-tax your CPU, maybe in the process overheating your computer, setting
it and your house ablaze, and getting a nice little article in the community newspaper about your former home.

Seriously, don't use this for anything *real* yet.  It's not ready.  The author, his family, his dogs, etc. accept NO LIABILITY
for anything that goes wrong with its usage.

In the unlikely event if you see a block of code that looks useful, feel free to copy it.  Feel free to fork the project, make it better,
and submit PRs so everybody else can benefit.  Other than that, redistribution of this application, or any of its components (with the 
obvious exception of its copy-left dependencies) is discouraged and, to the extent its dependent licenses permit, is not allowed.
Things in this application are likely to change a lot (hopefully for the better) and prematurely distributing it would just be a big PITA anyways.

At some point, this project *will* be in a state that is worth distributing, and will get a nice open source license attached to it.

But... Not Yet
